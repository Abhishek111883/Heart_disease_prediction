# Heart_disease_prediction
 This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation. We have employed various machine learning algorithms and carefully assessed their performance using key metrics. This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding heart disease prediction and can be used as a foundation for further research and application development in the healthcare domain. Explore the code, data, and detailed documentation to gain insights into the process of building and evaluating predictive models for heart disease risk assessment.
